# Approach Explanation for Challenge 1b PDF Analysis

The Challenge 1b solution implements a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing multiple collections of PDF documents and extracting relevant content tailored to specific user personas and tasks. The approach combines advanced natural language processing techniques, machine learning models, and semantic ranking to deliver structured and meaningful outputs.

## Document Processing Pipeline

The pipeline begins by loading input configurations that specify the documents to process, the user persona, and the job to be done. Each PDF document is processed individually by extracting text blocks using `pdfminer.six`. These blocks capture text content along with font and layout features such as font size, boldness, position, and bounding boxes.

## Heading Prediction and Text Extraction

A custom-trained heading classification model based on DistilBERT is used to predict the structural elements of each document, including titles, headings at multiple levels (H1, H2, H3), and body text. This model integrates textual embeddings with additional numerical features extracted from the document layout to improve accuracy. The model was trained on a custom dataset created by hand-annotating PDFs provided by the hackathon organizers, supplemented with additional annotations to enhance performance.

The extracted text blocks are grouped into meaningful paragraphs by merging lines that are close vertically on the same page. These paragraphs are then filtered for relevance based on persona-specific keywords and antonyms, ensuring that only content pertinent to the user's role and task is considered.

## Persona-Based Content Relevance Filtering

The solution incorporates persona configurations that define keywords and antonyms representing inclusion and exclusion criteria for content. This allows the system to tailor the extracted information to different user roles such as travel planners, researchers, or architects. Content that contains antonyms is excluded, while content containing keywords is prioritized.

## Semantic Ranking Using Embeddings and Zero-Shot Classification

To rank the extracted sections and paragraphs by relevance, the system employs sentence embeddings generated by the `sentence-transformers` library. It calculates semantic similarity scores between the content and the persona/task context. Additionally, a zero-shot classification model from the `transformers` library is used to further assess the relevance of text segments. These scores are combined with keyword matching scores to produce a final ranking, ensuring that the most contextually important content is selected.

## Output Generation

The final output is a structured JSON file containing metadata about the input documents, persona, and task, along with a ranked list of extracted sections and detailed subsection analyses. This output format facilitates downstream applications such as report generation, summarization, or further data processing.

## Use of NLP Libraries and Machine Learning Models

The solution leverages several state-of-the-art NLP libraries including `pdfminer.six` for PDF text extraction, `nltk` for text processing, `sentence-transformers` for semantic embeddings, and `transformers` for zero-shot classification. The custom heading classification model integrates transformer-based text encoding with layout features, demonstrating a hybrid approach to document structure analysis.

Overall, this approach provides a robust and flexible framework for multi-collection PDF analysis tailored to diverse user personas and tasks, combining machine learning, NLP, and semantic understanding to extract actionable insights from complex documents.
